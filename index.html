        <p>Plumbing is any system that conveys fluids for a wide range of applications. Plumbing uses pipes, valves, plumbing fixtures, tanks, and other apparatuses to convey fluids. Heating and cooling (HVAC), waste removal, and potable water delivery are among the most common uses for plumbing, but it is not limited to these applications. The word derives from the Latin for lead, plumbum, as the first effective pipes used in the Roman era were lead pipes.

            In the developed world, plumbing infrastructure is critical to public health and sanitation.
            
            Boilermakers and pipefitters are not plumbers although they work with piping as part of their trade and their work can include some plumbing. A water pipe is a pipe or tube, frequently made of plastic or metal,[a] that carries pressurized and treated fresh water to a building (as part of a municipal water system), as well as inside the building.Plumbing equipment includes devices often behind walls or in utility spaces which are not seen by the general public. It includes water meters, pumps, expansion tanks, back flow preventers, water filters, UV sterilization lights, water softeners, water heaters, heat exchangers, gauges, and control systems.
        
            There are many tools a plumber needs to do a good plumbing job. While many simple plumbing tasks can be completed with a few common hand held tools, other more complex jobs require specialised tools, designed specifically to make the job easier.
            
            Specialized plumbing tools include pipe wrenches, flaring pliers, pipe vise, pipe bending machine, pipe cutter, dies, and joining tools such as soldering torches and crimp tools. New tools have been developed to help plumbers fix problems more efficiently. For example, plumbers use video cameras for inspections of hidden leaks or other problems; they also use hydro jets, and high pressure hydraulic pumps connected to steel cables for trench-less sewer line replacement.
            
            Flooding from excessive rain or clogged sewers may require specialized equipment, such as a heavy duty pumper truck designed to vacuum raw sewage.</p>

            “I told my wife the truth. I told her I was seeing a psychiatrist. Then she told me the truth: that she was seeing a psychiatrist, two plumbers, and a bartender.”
        
        “If I had my life to live over again, I’d be a plumber.”
        
        “Let’s say I was a plumber, or I worked at a factory, I would download music, you feel what I’m saying?”
        
        “Television is like the invention of indoor plumbing. It didn’t change people’s habits. It just kept them inside the house.”
        
        “Had I been more responsible I might have made something of myself as a junk bond trader, long-haul trucker or perhaps a plumbing contractor.”
        
        “Not only is there no God, but try finding a plumber on Sunday.”
        
        “If I waited for inspiration every time I sat down to write a song I probably would be a plumber today.”
        
        “A plumber is an adventurer who traces leaky pipes to their source.”
        
        “Every actor is somewhat mad, or else he’d be a plumber or a bookkeeper or a salesman.”
        
        “Anybody who has any doubt about the ingenuity or the resourcefulness of a plumber never got a bill from one.”
        
        “Modern cynics and skeptics… see no harm in paying those to whom they entrust the minds of their children a smaller wage than is paid to those to whom they entrust the care of their plumbing.”
        
        “The process of competitively selecting contractors to perform work is based on a system of rewards and penalties, all distributed randomly.”
